## Introduction
 
### What is 30 Days of Google Cloud?
30 Days of Google Cloud program provides you an opportunity to kickstart your career in cloud and get hands-on practice on Google Cloud - the tool that powers apps like Google Search, Gmail and YouTube. Along the way you learn & practice concepts like computing, application development, big data & machine learning using cloud & if you get stuck, you will have your "Campus Facilitators" who are specially trained on Google Cloud to help. üòé

### Why should you participate in the program?
- You can showcase what you've learned here to your professional network using Google Cloud-hosted quest & skill badges that you can add to your resume and professional profiles like LinkedIn. üèÜ
- And on top of these amazing badges, you get a chance to win some really cool Google Cloud goodies*. üí™

### Program's Syllabus (TRACKS)
The program will introduce you to Computing, Application Development, Big Data & Machine Learning using Google Cloud's training platform called Qwiklabs where you will learn each of these topic using self-paced labs that provides you temporary credentials to Google Cloud, so you can learn the cloud using the real thing ‚Äì no simulations.

For convenience, Google has divided the topics above into 2 different tracks - Cloud Engineering Track and Data Science & Machine Learning Track.
#### Track 1: Cloud Engineering Track

### Download and setup the source code for deployment
#### Clone this repository
- Command to clone:&nbsp;&nbsp;```git clone https://github.com/DSC-SIES-GST/30-Days-of-Google-Cloud-Leaderboard.git```
#### Remove unwanted files and folders
- Delete the following files/folders from the repository:
    - README.md
    - screenshots/
#### Setup the project with the following steps:
- Change the content in ```leaderboard.csv``` to your own data having the following columns with the exact column names as shown below (Preferably don't change the first line in ```leaderboard.csv``` as it contains the column names):
    - Student Name
    - Total
- Open ```flask_app.py``` and change the following lines:
    - <b>Line 11</b>: Create a secret key for the application
    - <b>Line 14 to 23</b>: Add firebase credentials generated from the Firebase console previously

### Password generation
- Open https://www.random.org/strings/ and select the following options:
    - Number of Random strings
    - Length of each string
    - Type of characters to use
    - Each string should be unique (like raffle tickets)
- Click on the "Get Strings" button and copy the generated strings.
<img src="./screenshots/19.passwordGeneration.png"><br>
<img src="./screenshots/20.password.png"><br>
- Open an excel sheet and paste the generated strings in the following columns:
    - Student Email ID (To be taken from the data you have)
    - Password
- Save the excel sheet as ```student_authentication.csv```
- Sample output of the csv file:
<br><img src="./screenshots/21.studentAuthenticationCSV.png"><br>
- Open ```addUsers.py``` and add firebase credentials generated from the Firebase console previously on <b>Line 5 to 14</b>
- Ensure that you have installed [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) on your machine.
- Run the following commands in the command prompt in the same directory as this cloned repository, to install the required libraries:
    - ```py -m venv env```
    - ```source env/bin/activate``` (for ubuntu) or ```"env/Scripts/activate"``` (for windows) 
    - ```pip install pyrebase4```
    - ```pip install pandas```
- Run the script using the following command: ```py addUsers.py```. <span style="color: red;">(It is recommended to run the script for a maximum of 10 student configurations at a time to avoid the time limit of the script. To achieve this, keep only 10 student configurations in the csv file and run the script for each of them.)</style>
- The script will add the users to the database.
- Sample output of the script:
<img src="./screenshots/22.createUsers.png"><br>
- Firebase will automatically create a user with the email ID and password you have provided. Go to Users tab in the Firebase console and check the created users.
<img src="./screenshots/23.userCheck.png"><br>
- Once all the users are added, we are now ready to deploy the app to the Pythonanywhere server.
